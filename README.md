# Danom

Danom is a C# library that provides monadic structures to simplify functional programming patterns in C#.

## Key Features
- Implementation of common monads like `Option`, `Result`, and `ResultOption`.
- Fluent API for chaining operations.
- Error handling with monads.
- Integration with async/await for asynchronous operations.

## Design Goals
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use API for common monadic operations.
- **Performance**: Efficient implementation to minimize overhead.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing C# code and libraries.
- **Extensibility**: Allow users to create custom monads.

## Quick Start

## Options

Represents when an actual value might not exist for a value or named variable. An option has an underlying type and can hold a value of that type, or it might not have a value.

### Creating Options

```csharp
var option = Option<int>.Some(5);
// or, with no value
var optionNone = Option<int>.None();
```

### Using Options

Options are commonly used when a operation does not return a value.

```csharp
public IOption<int> TryFind(IEnumerable<int> numbers, Func<int, bool> predicate) =>
    numbers.FirstOrDefault(predicate).ToOption();
```

With this method defined we can begin performing operations against the Option result:

```csharp
IEnumerable<int> nums = [1,2,3];

// Exhasutive matching
TryFind(nums, x => x == 1)
    .Match(
        some: x => Console.WriteLine("Found: {0}", x),
        none: () => Console.WriteLine("Did not find number"));

// Mapping the value
var optionSum =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 1)
        .Map(x => x + 1);

// Binding the option
var optionBindSum =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 1)
        .Bind(num1 =>
            TryFind(nums, x => x == 2)
                .Map(num2 => num1 + num2));

// Handling "None"
var optionDefault =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 4)
        .DefaultValue(99);

var optionDefaultWith =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 4)
        .DefaultWith(() => 99); // useful if creating the value is expensive

var optionOrElse =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 4)
        .OrElse(Option.Some(99));

var optionOrElseWith =
    TryFind(nums, x => x == 4)
        .OrElseWith(() => 99);
```
